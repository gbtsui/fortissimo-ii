So this is the start of my keyboard! Hi! I'm Gabriel. This is going to be probably my first medium-scale PCB project!
I'm going to actually start design work for this on Sunday because I'm going to compete with my friends to see who can
keyboard the fastest. But my basic design concept is:

- split ortholinear design
- physical switch to toggle between languages/scripts (US QWERTY, French Canadian Multilingual, Greek layout, custom Hiragana layout, custom Katakana layout)
- low profile design
- neopixels reacting to events and languages
- OLED displays per side
- USB hub
- RP2040 (either a stamp or just a breakout board)

Yeah, that's about it!
